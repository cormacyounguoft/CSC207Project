1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

   Principle4: Perceptible Information
      a) We could add a feature for a text to speach option for poeple you cant see.
         We could add audio cues for certain important actions in the program 

   Principle 1: Equitable Use
      One feature is what he made the clickable icons big so poeple with weak eyesight can still navigate the program

   Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
      a) we could add a colour blind mode for colour blind poeple to use the program more easily
         We could add a dark mode for poeple how are sensitive to bright lights

   Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
      The program has a easy to nagigate UI, with bright easy to see colours and easy font to read. 

   Principle 4: Perceptible Information
      a) We could add a feature for a text to speach option for poeple you cant see.
         We could add audio cues for certain important actions in the program 

   Principle 5: Tolerance for Error:
      a) With the search bar if no movies are found, then it can show movies with similar names incase you miss spelled the title.
      When creating a account the program asks you to type your password twice, this greatly lowers the risk of miss typing the password when signing up.

   Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
      This principle doesn't apply to our program as the use of the computer physically is not under our control 

   Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
      This principle doesn't apply to our program as stated before the use of the computer is not under our control

4. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

This project would be marketed towards those who enjoy movies. It is a great way to keep track of the movies out there in addition to the ones you are intending to watch and have watched. It can provide for helpful sharing of movies you have enjoyed to your friends, serving as an accessible application providing you with movies right away.

3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.
   Individuals who are blind are less likely to use our program, since they more likely to listen to audiobooks.
   People who have no access to electricity and less likely to use this program as they probably do not watch many movies.
   People who are out-door oriented and don't like to sit and watch movies wouldn't be interested in our program.
