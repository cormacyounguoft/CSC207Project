# Accessibility Report

### For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:
   1. Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or 
   2. Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

#### Principle 1: Equitable Use
Our program uses clear text labels for all buttons. In the future, we could implement a screen-reader mode for visually impaired users or keyboard shortcuts for users who struggle with mouse controls.

#### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
Adding voice command support or customizable shortcuts could further improve adaptability for users with diverse needs. A dark mode could also be implemented to make the program more comfortable for users sensitive to bright light.

#### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
The program has an easy-to-navigate user interface with bright, high-contrast colors and a readable font. Labels and instructions are straightforward, ensuring users can intuitively understand how to interact with the application.

#### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
Visual feedback is provided through success and error messages. Adding audio cues for critical actions would provide non-visual feedback, making the program more inclusive.

#### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
The search bar suggests similar movie titles when no exact match is found, reducing frustration caused by typos. The program asks users to re-enter their passwords during account creation, minimizing the risk of errors while signing up. In the future, we could add undo functionality and confirmation prompts for critical actions.

#### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
Many actions in the app return the user to the logged-in view, minimizing the need to repeatedly navigate back to the main page. However, repetitive actions like removing multiple movies from the watchlist require users to manually return to the watchlist each time, which could be optimized in the future to streamline the process and reduce effort.

#### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
The program's interface is resizable, making it accessible on a variety of devices. Expanding support to mobile devices and tablets would make it even more versatile.

### Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.
This program would be marketed towards movie enthusiasts who enjoy keeping track of films they have watched or plan to watch. It offers an organized way to manage personal movie collections and provides tools for sharing watchlists with friends. It's perfect for casual users looking for a simple app to track their favorite movies. Additionally, data driven users would seek interest in our application due to the program’s dashboard, with insights like time spent watching and movie genre preferences, appeals to users who enjoy analyzing their viewing patterns. Families and friends who socialize about movies would find our program very useful as it allows you to export your watched list, serving as a recommendation tool to those around you.

### Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.
Certain demographics, such as individuals with limited digital literacy or those without access to reliable technology, like stable internet or electricity, may be less likely to use the program. Non-tech-savvy individuals may struggle to navigate the app's features, as it assumes a level of familiarity with technology that not all users possess. This highlights a lack of inclusive design, which is a core ethical consideration. Similarly, users with visual, motor, or cognitive impairments may face barriers if accessibility features like screen reader support, voice commands, or adaptable interfaces are not integrated. This oversight fails to prioritize equity and accessibility, central tenets in ethical development. Furthermore, children might find the app unsuitable due to its complexity and the potential risks of data collection, raising concerns about privacy and child safety, as emphasized in laws like COPPA. Non-movie watchers, while not inherently excluded, are unlikely to find value in the app, which emphasizes features tailored for movie enthusiasts, illustrating the importance of maintaining a clear purpose and audience alignment. Lastly, non-English speakers may face challenges if the app lacks multilingual support, limiting its accessibility and ignoring the principle of global inclusivity. Addressing these issues through thoughtful design can ensure the app serves a wider and more diverse audience ethically.
